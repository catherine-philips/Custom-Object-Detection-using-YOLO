# üèè Custom Object Detection Using YOLO

## üìÑ Overview

This project focuses on leveraging **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**, a real-time object detection algorithm, to detect specific objects using custom datasets. The project is centered around detecting cricket balls and aims to achieve high accuracy in identifying objects in images.

YOLO's architecture allows it to simultaneously predict multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects within an image, making it a popular choice for real-time applications. By training it on a custom dataset, YOLO can be adapted to detect any specific objects, providing robust solutions for various detection tasks.
